Processing 4 WebSocket Broadcaster
__________________________________

This is a simple webSocket server which broadcasts back any incoming message to all its clients.
It can be used for P5JS clients to communicate between themselves remotely.
(each one may want to ignore its own echoed message...)

You will need to actively import websockets library, in Processing IDE:
Sketch --> Import Library --> Manage Libraries -->  Libraries --> websockets...


You may find an EXE file exported from this code here (download and extract the zipped folder):

...If it's not there anymore - open the folder in Processing IDE and run/export it from there.


Example of P5JS code that uses this server can be found here:
